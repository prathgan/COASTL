# Notes
## Ideas for Future Implementation
- Check compatibility of two contracts explicitly before computing composition
- Simplify signal temporal logic in A & G sets using SymPy Logic module (https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/logic.html)
## Must Include in Docs
- One "&&" operator can only relate two expressions, with each multi-part expression enclosed in a set of parentheses. If you want to express A && B && C, you have to do "(A && B) && C"
