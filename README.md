# COASTL (Contract Operations and Signal Temporal Logic)
Lightweight Python package for doing operations concerning A/G contracts in design-by-contract systems design. Also has functionality to read Signal Temporal Logic into operable structure and derive corresponding boolean and synthesis constraints. Developed at DesCyPhy Lab, USC

- write more about what contracts are and what the use case is in this situation

## Installation
### Prerequisites
For the following prerequisites, if not already installed, a `pip install` should suffice:
- `sympy`
- `numpy`
- `re`
This package also requires a functioning installation of Gurobi, an optimization solver tool used heavily in coastl. Once you have installed Gurobi (https://www.gurobi.com), navigate to the Gurobi `<intstalldir>` and execute `python setup.py install`.
### Install coastl
1) download .zip file of this repository
2) navigate to directory where coastl `setup.py` file is located
3) `pip install .`
